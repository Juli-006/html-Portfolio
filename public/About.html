<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Music has always played a major role in my life, and I've always had a deep passion for it. Whether I'm singing in the shower or tapping along to my favorite tunes, there's something about music that brings me pure joy and happiness. I've always dreamed of being able to pursue music as a profession, because what could be better than doing what you love every single day? While I enjoy coding as a hobby, I don't think I could ever see myself having a career in it. Music just has a way of touching my soul and making me feel alive in ways that coding never could I want to be able to bring that same joy and emotion to others through my music. So, even though a career in music may not be the most stable or secure path to take, I'm willing to take the risk and do whatever it takes to make it happen</p>

<p>Currently, I'm studying medicine, but it's not exactly my cup of tea. Don't get me wrong, I understand the importance of medicine and the impact it has on people's lives. However, it's not a field that excites me or ignites my passion The only reason I'm pursuing medicine is because of my parents' expectations. They believe it's a respectable and secure career choice, and they want the best for me. While I appreciate their concern and support, I can't help but feel trapped in a career path that doesn't align with my true interests and aspirations. Despite feeling this way, I still hope that one day I'll be able to break free from these expectations and pursue my dreams. Whether it's through music or another creative outlet, I want to be able to express myself fully and make a positive impact on the world in a way that brings me genuine fulfillment</p>

<p>I'm not the most outgoing or fun person, to be honest I tend to keep to myself and prefer quiet and solitude. However, I am a bit more comfortable opening up to people I know. All I really want is a peaceful life, although a bit of chaos every now and then wouldn't hurt. That's pretty much it, nothing too complicated.</p>
